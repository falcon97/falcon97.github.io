I am a Data Science aficionado, open to new experiences that help build my career as a Data Scientist.

As a self-motivated and constant learner, I have learned to be highly adaptable and collaborative in all kinds of situations. I strongly believe I have a lot of offer as I work towards utilizing opportunities that help me become a valuable asset in the industry.

When I am not coding, you can find me clicking photos, playing music, or visiting new places.

You can reach out to me by filling out the contact form below.
