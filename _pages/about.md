I am a Data Science aficionado, actively looking for internships and full-time opportunities. I am a self-motivated and evolving learner, open to new experiences that help build my career as a Data Scientist.

I am currently pursuing a masters degree in Data Science at University at Buffalo, during the course of which I have gained hands-on experience in Machine Learning techniques (supervised and unsupervised), statistical analysis, database modelling and Python programming.

When I am not coding, you can find me clicking photos, playing music, or visiting new places.

You can reach out to me by filling out the contact form below.
