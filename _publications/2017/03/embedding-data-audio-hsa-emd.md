## Abstract
Piracy on the internet has been a long plaguing problem and it has made digital watermarking schemes to play an important role in handling such issues. In this paper, an adaptive watermarking algorithm HSA-EMD is used. Each audio signal is divided into frames and decomposed into intrinsic mode function (IMF). Each IMF has its own number of extrema and minima. The watermark is embedded into the extrema of last IMF. Hence the location of watermark cannot be detected. The proposed scheme is highly robust against various attacks. It gives improved performance than the existing schemes. Thus watermarked IMF is less sensitive to common signal processing attacks.
